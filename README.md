# Shell Grease
This is a collection of various scripts to make things slicker while working in a shell.

## Highlights
 * snapshot - Similar to doing a `tail -f` on a file, this will send the output to the screen and to another file (so you can see what you just captured).
 * count - Shows how many files in the sub-dirs of the current dir. Useful for quick confirmation that something was written out.
